#topic = I used the MongoDB structure, which is a NoSQL product, for my project named student enrollment system to store data. I planned to develop with C # as the programming language. I plan to use adonet or entityframework to connect these two structures. With the help of the program, we can enroll students in the system, update an existing student, bring the student list and delete student records.
